    "## Challenge #2: Spearman’s Footrule Distance\n",
    "Suppose we have several different methods for scoring a set of items; perhaps we’re asking different people, or using different scoring algorithms. We’d like to figure out how to aggregate these to produce a single combined ranking.\n",
    "A useful tool here is Spearman’s Footrule Distance which computes the distance between two rankings (Don’t worry, we don’t expect you to have heard of this before, we expect you to do some Googling…)\n",
    "Your task here is to implement a function with the following signature:\n",
    "def sumSpearmanDistances(scores, proposedRanking):\n",
    "    “””Calculate the sum of Spearman’s Footrule Distances for a given proposedRanking.\n",
    "    scores : A dict of {itemId: tuple of scores} e.g. {‘A’: [100, 0.1], ‘B’: [90, 0.3], ‘C’: [20, 0.2]} \n",
    "        means that item ‘A’ was given a score of 100 by metric 1 and a score of 0.1 by metric 2 etc\n",
    "    proposedRanking : An ordered list of itemIds where the first entry is the proposed-best and last entry is \n",
    "        the proposed worst e.g. [‘A’, ‘B’, ‘C’]\n",
    "    “””\n",
    "Please think about splitting your function into appropriate sub-functions and add tests to demonstrate that everything works as expected. You may assume in your implementation that higher score = better. You can implement this as a Jupyter notebook, or a standalone Python module. "
